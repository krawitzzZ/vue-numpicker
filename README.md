## Start the NumPicker app locally

To start the app locally you need to install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn
```

To start the dev server type:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Or if you prefer `yarn`:

```sh
yarn run dev
```

Now you can navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` and observe the app.
